<h1 class="mc"> MINECRAFT </h1>
<p> 
    Minecraft is a block game made by Notch. It is a 3D game made in java. Its a sandbox adventure game in wich you need to survive and mine to 
    get better gear and build to protect yourself or just do it for fun. The first version was just a plain field with grass blocks and rocks bellow
    the and the was nothing special.
